# Key-Stroke-Emulator-Android-App

Mos basic Android app for emulating key strokes on A PC. The app was made in 30 mins and was made because it was cold and I had to study for a midterm and I didn't want to take my hands out of the duvet to change the slides.

The bluetooth uuid has been hardcoded to use my phone but it is not diffcult to extend this to detect new devices. Cheers!
